\description{
This data set contains all pairwise physical distance between landmarks in
ventral and dorsal anchors of samples from 13 \emph{Ligophorus species}.
}
\details{
The pairwise physical distances are estimated from a subset (n=97) of the 443 samples based on a regression equation,
using physical distances between landmarks 1 to 3 and landmarks 1 to 5 and corresponding distances computed from \code{pwdist},
which have arbitrary units.
